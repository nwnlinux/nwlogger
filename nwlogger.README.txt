Various bits of public info:

This is a _CLIENT_SIDE_ logging package for NWN & Linux.  It is supposed to 
log all of the data that appears in the chat log window.  It also logs
one or two other things that sometimes don't get logged that I think should. 
(You can tell those lines as they're tagged with a 'NWL:' at the front.) 

There is nwnplayer.ini/[Game Options]/ClientEntireChatWindowLogging=1
setting that may make this project obsolete, however, I still keep it around 
for umm..umm... no good reason. <shrug>

This is very much a kludge. (IMHO)  With the actual source, I'm sure I could
do better, but as I'm not a Bioware employee, I find that highly unlikely.

Standard Legal Shtuff:

I do not guarentee this to work on any computer, except my own.   If it
should some how allow all the magic smoke to escape your computer, well
tough.  You were warned.   Avoid swimming for at least three hours after
using this product.

What little bit of this that is copyrightable is copywritten by David Holland
david.w.holland@gmail.com.   You may do what you wish with this code so long as
some credit is given to me, and the copyright is maintained.

If someone would like to send me better installation instructions, I'll
gladly update the package with them.   Along with any code
updates.

Flames will be redirected to /dev/null.   As will testy bug reports.
Friendly bug reports will be examined as time permits.

----> enough disclaimers <----

Things required:
gcc, Perl, & libelf, including development headers.

If building on x86_64, you will need the 32bit development 
libraries.

1) Unpack the tarball in your NWN directory.

2) execute ./nwlogger_install.pl

3) modify your 'nwn' startup script to include the
following line:

export LD_PRELOAD=./nwlogger.so

   before executing nwmain

   If your using nwmovies, the line should look something like so: 

export LD_PRELOAD=./nwmovies.so:./nwlogger.so

4) You may wish to do something similar for the 
   dmclient startup script.

5) Enjoy.. (mostly - See the known issues below)

6) There is a bit of a log file in nwlogger.log and nwlogger_save.log. 
   You may wish to modify your nwn startup script to remove them
   occasionally.

----> Known Issues <-----

None.  Yet.

Updated for x86_64, and verified to work on 1.68, and 1.69b2

My thanks to Eyrdan, and Skildron on the NWN forums for there help
getting this to work on x86_64.

Heavily based up on the nwmovies code. 

The ~nwn/nwlogger.log file is the "in progress" log file.

The nwlogger.log file is a raw dump of the "Chat" window log string.  It has 
binary bits in it.  

Per 'Evil Penguin' on the Linux forums the binary bits
are a color code.  <cRGB> starts a change of color, and </c> ends it

R, G, and B, are single characters, which represent the respective color value.

White appears to be the default. 

There is a bit of a "stack" concept to the color codes.    
(FYI - these are not example codes - Just a stack example)

<c 'red'><c 'blue'>Blue Text</c>Red text</c>White text. 

The enclosed 'log2html.pl' given a filename, treats the file as a 
nwlogger.log file, and converts the chatlog into HTML on standard out. 

The field in front of a log line is the fields of a 'struct tm', in the 
following order. 

tm_ptr->tm_year + 1900,			Year
tm_ptr->tm_mon + 1,			Month
tm_ptr->tm_mday,			Day of the Month
tm_ptr->tm_hour,			Hour
tm_ptr->tm_min,				Minute
tm_ptr->tm_sec,				Second
tm_ptr->tm_wday,			Day of the Week
tm_ptr->tm_yday,			Day of the Year. 
tm_ptr->tm_isdst 			Is it DayLight Savings? 

./nwlogger.pl is called with a single argument when you go to save your game.
said argument is the directory where the files that make up your
save game is. 

Loading a save game does NOT whack a in progress game log.  If you wish
it to uncomment the call to ftruncate() inside of nwlogger.c / NWLogger_write_load_log(), 
and rebuild.
